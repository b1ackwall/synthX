 *
 * Structurally identical to [com.v1per.synthx.ui.components.PlayerSheetValue], and declared
 * fresh anyway rather than reused: that enum belongs to the old player's still-live call
 * graph, and v2 is meant to share nothing with it but the theme tokens and

/**
 * Stage 1.1 of the player rebuild — see docs/player-rebuild-design.md for the eventual
 * target architecture.
 *
 * This is deliberately, aggressively incomplete: a blank dark surface that morphs between a
 * 64dp mini bar and a full-height sheet, and nothing else. No album art, no title, no
 * transport controls, no seek bar, no queue, no playback state — it takes no parameters
 * because it has nothing to render.
 *
 * Deliberate divergences from docs/player-rebuild-design.md, all scoped to this stage:
 * - The design doc's mechanism is SeekableTransitionState inside a SharedTransitionLayout
 *   (§1). This uses [AnchoredDraggableState] instead, because at two states with no shared
 *   elements and no content to reveal, the transition machinery would buy nothing while the
 *   old player's AnchoredDraggable drag/settle path is already proven on this exact gesture.
 *   Swapping the mechanism is its own later step.
 * - No BackHandler, and no tap-to-collapse. Dragging down is currently the only way back to
 *   Collapsed.
 *
 * Stage 1.2 has since added the nav coordination that this list previously called out as
 * missing (§5): [onProgressChanged] reports the live drag progress outward, and the sheet
 * applies the matching bottom inset so the collapsed bar stacks above the nav rather than
 * overlaying it. Everything else above still stands.
 *
 * Every gesture constant here is copied verbatim from
 * [com.v1per.synthx.ui.player.PlayerSheetSkeleton] rather than re-tuned — the 0.4f
 * positional threshold, the 200dp velocity threshold, exponentialDecay's 1.8f friction
 * multiplier and [Motion.SpringStandard] as the snap spec.
 *
 * @param onProgressChanged called with the live 0..1 collapse/expand progress whenever it
 *   changes, so chrome outside this composable (the bottom nav) can move in lockstep. Fired
 *   from a [SideEffect] rather than from the composition body — see the call site below.
